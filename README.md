# 🚀 Oxgood's AWS Cloud Journey

Welcome to my public portfolio documenting my hands-on journey into **Cloud Engineering using AWS**. This repository contains real infrastructure I've built and tested using various AWS services — manually via the AWS Console, CLI, and scripting.

## 🧭 What's Inside

Each folder in this repository represents a key milestone in my learning and building process.

### ✅ `ec2-setup/`
Manual setup of two EC2 instances running Apache web servers:
- SSH access via PowerShell
- Apache installation and server configuration
- Load balancer setup with health checks
- Auto Scaling Group using a Launch Template
- Security group configurations and debugging
- Real-world issues resolved (e.g., inaccessible site due to SG mismatch)

→ **Status:** ✅ Completed  
→ [See EC2 folder](./ec2-setup)

### 🛠️ `s3-website-hosting/` *(Coming soon)*
Hosting a static website directly from an S3 bucket:
- Uploading HTML files
- Setting bucket policies
- Making content publicly accessible
- Enabling static hosting and testing

→ **Status:** 🧱 In Progress

## 💡 Why This Exists

As part of my transition into **Cloud Engineering**, I decided to build my skills the right way — not just watching tutorials, but launching real services, fixing real issues, and documenting everything like a professional.
